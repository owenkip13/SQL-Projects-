# **MySQL Data Cleaning Project**

## Overview
This project focuses on the crucial step of data cleaning using MySQL, preparing a raw dataset for thorough exploratory analysis. By addressing common data quality issues, such as duplicates and null values, the project ensures that the data is accurate and reliable for subsequent analysis.

### Project Features

- **Data Import**: Imported the dataset into MySQL, establishing a structured environment for data cleaning.

* **Duplicate Removal**: Identified and removed duplicate records to eliminate redundancy.

+ **Data Standardization**: Ensured consistency in data formats, such as date formats and text entries.

+ **Null Value Management**: Evaluated the relevance of null values in specific columns, deciding whether to retain, replace, or remove them.

+ **Column Relevance Analysis**: Assessed the importance of various columns, removing those irrelevant for future analysis to streamline the dataset.

### Tools Used
MySQL

## Learning Outcomes
Proficiency in MySQL for data cleaning tasks.

Enhanced ability to prepare datasets for comprehensive analysis.

# MySQL Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using MySQL. The primary objective was to clean and prepare the dataset, followed by in-depth analysis to extract meaningful insights. The project demonstrates how MySQL can be leveraged for comprehensive data analysis, including data import, transformation, and querying.

### Project Features
- **Data Import**: Imported a clean, complex dataset from previous MySQL Data Cleaning Project into MySQL for analysis.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Used SQL queries to perform descriptive statistics, identify trends, and uncover patterns within the data.
- **Result Interpretation**: Analyzed the results to derive actionable insights that can inform decision-making.

## Tools Used
MySQL

## Learning Outcomes
- Enhanced proficiency in MySQL for data analysis and EDA.
- Improved skills in data cleaning and preparation.
- Developed the ability to draw insights from complex datasets using SQL.

## Future Work
Extend the analysis to include more advanced statistical methods.

Visualize the findings using tools like Power BI or Tableau for enhanced data storytelling.
