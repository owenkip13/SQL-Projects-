# **MySQL Data Cleaning Project**

## Overview
This project focuses on the crucial step of data cleaning using MySQL, preparing a raw dataset for thorough exploratory analysis. By addressing common data quality issues, such as duplicates and null values, the project ensures that the data is accurate and reliable for subsequent analysis.

### Project Features

- **Data Import**: Imported the dataset into MySQL, establishing a structured environment for data cleaning.

* **Duplicate Removal**: Identified and removed duplicate records to eliminate redundancy.

+ **Data Standardization**: Ensured consistency in data formats, such as date formats and text entries.

+ **Null Value Management**: Evaluated the relevance of null values in specific columns, deciding whether to retain, replace, or remove them.

+ **Column Relevance Analysis**: Assessed the importance of various columns, removing those irrelevant for future analysis to streamline the dataset.

### Tools Used
MySQL

## Learning Outcomes
Proficiency in MySQL for data cleaning tasks.

Enhanced ability to prepare datasets for comprehensive analysis.
